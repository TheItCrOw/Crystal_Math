## About

Crystal Math is a math based game (who would have thought) where your goal is to fill up your crystal with energy so you can fly off the planet again. Luckily, there is energy swarming around everywhere which the crystal can suck in. The problem: Not all energy formulars are suited for the crystal. That is where you as the player come in action: You have to quickly calculate the formular of each energy ball that is flying towards the crystal. If the formular is correct, let the energy be absorbed by your crystal. Otheriwse, destroy the energy by touching it.

Incorrect formular (8-4 != -3)| Correct formular

## Closure

Crystal Math was a game I made in Unity within a few weeks over 3 years ago. Since Unity projects really dont fit in a git repository yet alone on github, I only added the scripts to this repo where all the code lies. The project and its code really showcase my early tries at being a developer, so it definetly has its flaws. I didn't know about conventions, structures or any of that. I just started and learned along the way. But this project helped me land my first job as a SE, so it will always have a special place upon my projects.
